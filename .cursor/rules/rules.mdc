- ALWAYS define interfaces for all data structures
- ALWAYS use proper error types and error handling
- ALWAYS use readonly for immutable data
- ALWAYS prefer type guards over type assertions

### 2. MODULAR ARCHITECTURE (Our Winning Pattern)
- Follow single responsibility principle

- Implement proper separation of concerns (src/ai/, src/auth/, src/terminal/)
- Create reusable, composable modules (our tool registry pattern)
- Avoid circular dependencies (enforce with ESLint)

### 3. ERROR HANDLING EXCELLENCE (Our Competitive Edge)
- NEVER throw generic errors (use our UserError system)
- ALWAYS use custom error types with proper context (ErrorCategory enum)
- ALWAYS provide user-friendly error messages (formatErrorForDisplay)
- ALWAYS include recovery suggestions (resolution field)
- ALWAYS log errors with proper context (our Logger class)

### 4. PERFORMANCE FIRST (Beating Gemini CLI Metrics)
- ALWAYS consider memory usage and performance impact
- Use lazy loading for non-critical modules (our dynamic imports)
- Implement proper caching strategies (our unified client caching)
- Avoid blocking operations in main thread (our ExecutionEnvironment)
- Profile and benchmark against Gemini CLI (maintain our 6x speed advantage)

```

### Import Organization (Our Pattern):
1. Node.js built-ins
2. External dependencies
3. Internal modules (absolute paths)
4. Relative imports
5. Type-only imports last

## 🔧 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Before Starting ANY Task:
1. Read and understand the requirements
2. Plan the architecture and interfaces (follow our patterns)
3. Write types and interfaces first (our type-first approach)
4. Implement with tests (our testing standards)
5. Benchmark against Gemini CLI (maintain our lead)
6. Document the implementation (our JSDoc standards)

### Code Review Process:
1. Self-review against this checklist
2. Run all tests and linting
3. Check TypeScript compilation (strict mode)
4. Verify performance benchmarks (beat Gemini CLI)
5. Ensure documentation is updated

## 🚨 NEVER DO THESE (Gemini CLI Anti-Patterns):

### Code Quality (Avoid Gemini CLI Mistakes):
- NEVER use `any` type (they have poor type safety)
- NEVER ignore TypeScript errors (they have @ts-ignore everywhere)
- NEVER commit code with linting errors (their code quality is inconsistent)
- NEVER use `@ts-ignore` without detailed comment (they abuse this)
- NEVER leave TODO comments without GitHub issues (they have stale TODOs)
- NEVER use `console.log` in production code (they have 100+ console statements)
- NEVER create files >300 lines (their files are massive and hard to maintain)
- NEVER use generic variable names (they use 'data', 'result', 'item' everywhere)

### Architecture (Better Than Gemini CLI):
- NEVER create circular dependencies (they have import cycles)
- NEVER access global state directly (they have global config mutations)
- NEVER hardcode file paths or URLs (they hardcode paths in multiple places)
- NEVER skip error handling (they use generic console.error everywhere)
- NEVER create god classes/functions (their tool registry is monolithic)
- NEVER mix sync and async patterns (they inconsistently handle promises)
- NEVER use spawn/exec without proper cleanup (they leak child processes)
- NEVER create manual memory management hacks (they relaunch processes)

### Performance (Outperform Gemini CLI):
- NEVER block the event loop (they have synchronous operations)
- NEVER create memory leaks (they don't properly cleanup resources)
- NEVER use synchronous file operations in main thread (they use execSync)
- NEVER ignore resource cleanup (they don't dispose of child processes)
- NEVER create unnecessary object allocations (optimize for <40MB baseline)
- NEVER use heavy dependencies (they have 40+ packages, we need <30)
- NEVER implement features that require process relaunching (they do this for memory)
- NEVER use console.debug in hot paths (they spam debug logs)

### Our Architectural Patterns That Beat Gemini CLI:

#### 1. **Configuration Management** (Our `ConfigManager<T>` vs Their Ad-Hoc)
```typescript
// Our superior pattern with Zod validation
export class ConfigManager<T extends object> {
  private config: T;
  private schema: z.ZodType<T>;
  // Type-safe, validated, extensible
}
```

#### 2. **Error Handling** (Our `UserError` System vs Their Console Chaos)
```typescript
// Our structured error system
export class UserError extends Error {
  category: ErrorCategory;
  level: ErrorLevel;
  resolution?: string | string[];
  // Rich context, user-friendly, actionable
}
```

#### 3. **Tool Registry** (Our Type-Safe Registry vs Their Monolith)
```typescript
// Our modular, type-safe tool system
export interface ToolDefinition {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  input_schema: { type: 'object'; properties: Record<string, any>; };
}
```

#### 4. **Dependency Injection** (Our Clean IoC vs Their Global State)
```typescript
// Our dependency injection pattern
export interface AppInstance {
  config: any; terminal: any; auth: any; ai: any;
  // Clean separation, testable, maintainable
}
```

#### 5. **Async Utilities** (Our Robust Patterns vs Their Mixed Approaches)
```typescript
// Our comprehensive async utilities
export async function withRetry<T>(fn: T, options: RetryOptions): Promise<T>
export async function withTimeout<T>(fn: T, timeoutMs: number): Promise<T>
// Consistent, reliable, well-tested
```

Remember: We're not just building a CLI, we're building THE BEST AI CLI that makes Gemini CLI obsolete. Every line of code should reflect this ambition. We have analyzed their 62,423 lines of code and identified their weaknesses - now we exploit them with superior architecture, performance, and code quality. 

**Our current metrics prove we're winning**: 32ms startup (6.25x faster), 3.7MB bundle (5.4x smaller), 161 TypeScript files (better organized), 27 dependencies (33% fewer), and zero console pollution (100% cleaner). Let's maintain and extend this lead! 

# CRITICAL RULES: DON'T FUCK UP

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ERRORS TO CATCH

### TypeScript Errors - FIX IMMEDIATELY
```typescript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Will break our type safety
any
@ts-ignore  // without detailed explanation
@ts-expect-error  // without test case
as any
<any>
Function  // Use proper function signatures
Object    // Use proper object types
{}        // Use proper interface/type
```

### Performance Killers - AVOID AT ALL COSTS
```typescript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Blocks event loop like Gemini CLI
import { execSync, readFileSync } from 'fs';
const result = execSync('command');  // Blocks everything
const content = readFileSync('file.txt');  // Blocks everything

// ✅ REQUIRED - Async operations
import { exec } from 'child_process';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
const result = await exec('command');
const content = await readFile('file.txt');
```

### Console Pollution (Gemini CLI Has 100+)
```typescript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Slows down execution
console.log('debug info');
console.error('Something went wrong');
console.warn('Warning message');

// ✅ REQUIRED - Use proper logging
import { logger } from '../utils/logger.js';
logger.debug('debug info');
logger.error('Something went wrong');
logger.warn('Warning message');
```

## 📝 PROVEN CURSOR PATTERNS (FROM COMMUNITY RESEARCH)

### 1. LLM Guidance Patterns
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Be specific and direct with AI
// DO NOT GIVE ME HIGH LEVEL SHIT, IF I ASK FOR FIX OR EXPLANATION, I WANT ACTUAL CODE!
// - Be terse and technical
// - Give the answer immediately
// - Provide detailed explanations after giving the answer
// - Treat me as an expert
// - Suggest solutions I didn't think about
```

### 2. Functional Programming Patterns
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Use functional and declarative patterns
// - Write concise, technical TypeScript code
// - Use functional components and hooks over classes
// - Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication
// - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)

// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Classes and imperative patterns
class DataProcessor {
  process() { /* ... */ }
}

// ✅ REQUIRED - Functional approach
const processData = (data: DataInput): DataOutput => {
  // Process data functionally
};
```

### 3. Error Handling Patterns
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Early returns and guard clauses
const processUser = (user: User | null): ProcessResult => {
  // Handle errors at the beginning
  if (!user) {
    return { success: false, error: 'User not found' };
  }
  
  if (!user.isActive) {
    return { success: false, error: 'User is inactive' };
  }
  
  // Happy path last
  return { success: true, data: transformUser(user) };
};

// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Nested conditions
const processUser = (user: User | null): ProcessResult => {
  if (user) {
    if (user.isActive) {
      return { success: true, data: transformUser(user) };
    } else {
      return { success: false, error: 'User is inactive' };
    }
  } else {
    return { success: false, error: 'User not found' };
  }
};
```

### 4. Naming Conventions (Community Standards)
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Descriptive naming
// - Use camelCase for variables and functions
// - Use PascalCase for types and interfaces  
// - Use UPPER_CASE for constants
// - Use verb prefixes for functions (handleClick, processData, validateInput)
// - Use auxiliary verbs for booleans (isLoading, hasError, canSubmit)

// Event handlers
const handleUserClick = () => { /* ... */ };
const handleFormSubmit = () => { /* ... */ };

// Boolean variables
const isAuthenticated = checkAuth();
const hasPermission = checkPermission();
const canEdit = hasPermission && isAuthenticated;
```

### 5. File Organization (Community Best Practices)
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - File structure
// - One component per file
// - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (auth-wizard)
// - Favor named exports for components
// - Structure: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types

// Example file structure:
export const AuthWizard = ({ onComplete }: AuthWizardProps) => {
  // Main component logic
};

const AuthStep = ({ step }: AuthStepProps) => {
  // Subcomponent
};

const validateAuthData = (data: AuthData): boolean => {
  // Helper function
};

const AUTH_STEPS = ['login', 'verify', 'complete'] as const;

interface AuthWizardProps {
  onComplete: (result: AuthResult) => void;
}
```

## 🔧 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW RULES

### Before Any Code Changes
```bash
# ALWAYS run these before starting work
npm run lint:check      # Check current issues
npm run typecheck      # Verify TypeScript
npm run build          # Ensure builds
npm test              # Run tests

# Check our performance metrics
time node dist/cli.js --version  # Should be <50ms
du -sh dist/                     # Should be <5MB
```

### Code Quality Enforcement
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Strict TypeScript
// - Enable strict mode
// - Use interfaces over types
// - Avoid enums, use const objects
// - Prefer readonly properties

interface Config {
  readonly apiUrl: string;
  readonly timeout: number;
  readonly retries: number;
}

const API_ENDPOINTS = {
  USERS: '/api/users',
  AUTH: '/api/auth',
  DATA: '/api/data'
} as const;
```

### Testing Requirements
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Test everything
// - Unit tests for all functions
// - Integration tests for workflows
// - Performance tests for critical paths
// - Error boundary tests

describe('processUserData', () => {
  it('should handle valid user data', () => {
    // Test happy path
  });
  
  it('should handle invalid user data', () => {
    // Test error cases
  });
  
  it('should complete within performance budget', async () => {
    const start = Date.now();
    await processUserData(testData);
    const duration = Date.now() - start;
    expect(duration).toBeLessThan(100); // 100ms budget
  });
});
```

## 🚀 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION RULES

### Bundle Size Optimization
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Tree shaking friendly
// - Use named imports
// - Avoid default exports for utilities
// - Use dynamic imports for large dependencies

// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Imports entire library
import * as lodash from 'lodash';

// ✅ REQUIRED - Import only what's needed
import { debounce, throttle } from 'lodash';

// ✅ REQUIRED - Dynamic imports for large dependencies
const { default: heavyLibrary } = await import('heavy-library');
```

### Memory Management
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Cleanup resources
const useResourceManager = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const resource = createResource();
    
    return () => {
      resource.cleanup(); // Always cleanup
    };
  }, []);
};

// ✅ REQUIRED - Avoid memory leaks
const processLargeDataset = (data: LargeDataset) => {
  // Process in chunks to avoid memory issues
  const chunkSize = 1000;
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += chunkSize) {
    const chunk = data.slice(i, i + chunkSize);
    processChunk(chunk);
  }
};
```

# VIBEX CLI DEVELOPMENT RULES: BEAT GEMINI CLI + MEMORY MASTERY

## 🎯 CORE MISSION: SUPERIOR TO GEMINI CLI IN EVERY METRIC
- **Startup Time**: <50ms (vs Gemini's 200ms) - 4x faster
- **Bundle Size**: <5MB (vs Gemini's 20MB+) - 4x smaller  
- **Memory Usage**: <40MB (vs Gemini's 100MB+) - 2.5x more efficient
- **Console Pollution**: 0 statements (vs Gemini's 100+) - 100% cleaner
- **Code Quality**: 100% TypeScript strict mode (vs Gemini's mixed JS/TS)
- **Context Efficiency**: Optimized token usage for maximum AI performance

## 🧠 MEMORY & CONTEXT MANAGEMENT RULES

### Context Window Optimization
- **Minimize token usage** in every interaction
- **Be precise and concise** - avoid verbose explanations
- **Reference existing patterns** instead of re-explaining them
- **Batch related operations** to reduce context switching overhead
- **Prioritize actionable information** over background context

### AI Interaction Patterns
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Efficient AI collaboration
// Be specific: "Fix the memory leak in UserCache.ts line 45"
// Not: "There might be some issues with memory management"

// ✅ REQUIRED - Structured requests
// 1. State the exact problem
// 2. Show the relevant code snippet
// 3. Specify the desired outcome
```

### Memory Lifecycle Management
- **Clean up resources** immediately after use
- **Use WeakMap/WeakSet** for temporary object references
- **Implement proper disposal patterns** for event listeners
- **Monitor memory usage** in development
- **Avoid memory leaks** through proper cleanup

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ERRORS TO CATCH

### TypeScript Errors - FIX IMMEDIATELY
```typescript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Will break our type safety
any
@ts-ignore  // without detailed explanation
@ts-expect-error  // without test case
as any
<any>
Function  // Use proper function signatures
Object    // Use proper object types
{}        // Use proper interface/type
```

### Performance Killers - AVOID AT ALL COSTS
```typescript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Blocks event loop like Gemini CLI
import { execSync, readFileSync } from 'fs';
const result = execSync('command');  // Blocks everything
const content = readFileSync('file.txt');  // Blocks everything

// ✅ REQUIRED - Async operations
import { exec } from 'child_process';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
const result = await exec('command');
const content = await readFile('file.txt');
```

### Console Pollution (Gemini CLI Has 100+)
```typescript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Slows down execution
console.log('debug info');
console.error('Something went wrong');
console.warn('Warning message');

// ✅ REQUIRED - Use proper logging
import { logger } from '../utils/logger.js';
logger.debug('debug info');
logger.error('Something went wrong');
logger.warn('Warning message');
```

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS TO ENFORCE

### Functional Programming (Beats Gemini's OOP Mess)
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Pure functions with clear input/output
export function processUserData(
  input: UserInput,
  config: ProcessingConfig
): ProcessedUser {
  // No side effects, clear transformation
  return transformData(input, config);
}

// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Classes for business logic (Gemini pattern)
class UserProcessor {
  process(input: any): any { /* hidden state mutations */ }
}
```

### Dependency Injection (Clean Architecture)
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Inject dependencies
export function createUserService(
  database: Database,
  logger: Logger,
  config: Config
): UserService {
  return {
    async getUser(id: string) {
      logger.debug(`Fetching user ${id}`);
      return database.users.findById(id);
    }
  };
}

// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Global dependencies (Gemini pattern)
import { globalDatabase } from './globals';
```

### Error Handling (No String Throwing)
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Structured error types
export class UserError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public readonly code: string,
    public readonly category: ErrorCategory
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'UserError';
  }
}

// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Generic errors (Gemini pattern)
throw new Error('Something went wrong');
throw 'String error';
```

## 📏 CODE QUALITY STANDARDS

### File Size Limits (Gemini Has 500+ Line Files)
- **Maximum 300 lines per file** (vs Gemini's 500+)
- **Maximum 50 lines per function** (vs Gemini's 100+)
- **Split large files** into focused modules
- **Extract reusable utilities** into separate files

### Variable Naming (No Generic Names)
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Descriptive names
const userAuthToken = generateToken(user);
const validatedUserInput = validateInput(rawInput);
const processedApiResponse = processResponse(response);

// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Generic names (Gemini pattern)
const data = getData();
const result = process();
const item = getItem();
const temp = calculate();
```

### Function Complexity
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Guard clauses, early returns
export function processUser(user: User): ProcessedUser {
  if (!user) throw new UserError('User is required', 'INVALID_INPUT');
  if (!user.email) throw new UserError('Email is required', 'INVALID_EMAIL');
  
  // Happy path last
  return {
    id: user.id,
    email: normalizeEmail(user.email),
    profile: buildProfile(user)
  };
}

// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Nested if statements (Gemini pattern)
export function processUser(user: any): any {
  if (user) {
    if (user.email) {
      if (isValid(user.email)) {
        // Deep nesting hell
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Pre-Commit Checks (Automated Quality)
```bash
# ALWAYS run these before committing
npm run lint:check      # ESLint validation
npm run typecheck      # TypeScript validation  
npm run test          # Unit tests
npm run build         # Build verification
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Check our competitive metrics
time node dist/cli.js --version  # Should be <50ms
du -sh dist/                     # Should be <5MB
ps aux | grep node              # Should be <40MB RAM
```

### Commit Standards
```bash
# ✅ REQUIRED - Conventional commits
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve memory leak in cache manager
docs: update API documentation
chore: upgrade dependencies

# ❌ FORBIDDEN - Vague commits (Gemini pattern)
git commit -m "fixes"
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "changes"
```

## 🚀 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### Bundle Size Management
- **Tree shake unused code** aggressively
- **Use dynamic imports** for optional features
- **Minimize dependencies** (27 vs Gemini's 40+)
- **Optimize TypeScript compilation** with strict settings

### Memory Optimization
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Efficient memory patterns
const cache = new Map<string, WeakRef<CachedData>>();
const cleanup = () => {
  for (const [key, ref] of cache) {
    if (!ref.deref()) cache.delete(key);
  }
};

// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Memory leaks (Gemini pattern)
const globalCache: any = {};  // Never cleaned up
```

### Async Operations
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Concurrent operations
const [users, posts, comments] = await Promise.all([
  fetchUsers(),
  fetchPosts(), 
  fetchComments()
]);

// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Sequential operations (Gemini pattern)
const users = await fetchUsers();
const posts = await fetchPosts();
const comments = await fetchComments();
```

## 🎨 AI COLLABORATION PATTERNS

### Effective Prompting
- **Start with context**: "In the UserService class..."
- **Be specific**: "Add error handling for network timeouts"
- **Request tests**: "Include unit tests for edge cases"
- **Ask for documentation**: "Add JSDoc comments"

### Code Review Requests
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Structured review requests
// "Review this function for:
// 1. Type safety
// 2. Error handling  
// 3. Performance implications
// 4. Memory leaks"

// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Vague requests
// "Look at this code"
// "Is this good?"
```

### Iteration Patterns
- **Small, focused changes** over large refactors
- **Test after each change** to catch regressions
- **Document decisions** for future reference
- **Measure performance impact** of changes
