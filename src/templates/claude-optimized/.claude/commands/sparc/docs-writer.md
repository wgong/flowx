### 5. Runbook Documentation

#### Incident Response Runbook Template
```markdown
# Payment Service Incident Response Runbook

## Overview
**Service**: Payment Processing API
**SLA**: 99.99% uptime, <100ms response time
**Business Impact**: $10k revenue per minute

## Alert Conditions
- Error rate > 0.1%
- Response time > 100ms (95th percentile)
- Availability < 99.95%

## Immediate Response (First 5 minutes)
1. **Acknowledge Alert**: Confirm receipt in PagerDuty
2. **Check Dashboard**: https://monitoring.enterprise.com/payments
3. **Assess Impact**: Determine scope and user impact
4. **Communicate**: Update #incidents Slack channel

## Investigation Steps
### Step 1: Service Health Check
```bash
# Check service status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://api.enterprise.com/v2/health

# Expected response: {"status": "healthy", "version": "2.1.0"}
```

### Step 2: Database Health
```bash
# Check database connectivity
kubectl exec -it payment-db-0 -- psql -U payment -c "SELECT 1;"

# Check for blocking queries
kubectl exec -it payment-db-0 -- psql -U payment -c "
  SELECT pid, query, state, query_start 
  FROM pg_stat_activity 
  WHERE state != 'idle' 
  ORDER BY query_start;"
```

### Step 3: Traffic Analysis
```bash
# Check traffic patterns
kubectl logs -l app=payment-service --tail=100 | grep ERROR

# Check for rate limiting
kubectl logs -l app=nginx-ingress | grep "rate limit"
```

## Escalation Procedures
- **Level 1**: On-call engineer (immediate)
- **Level 2**: Senior engineer (15 minutes)
- **Level 3**: Engineering manager (30 minutes)
- **Level 4**: VP Engineering (1 hour)

## Recovery Actions
### Quick Fixes
1. **Scale Up**: Increase replica count
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Enable circuit breaker if available
3. **Traffic Routing**: Route traffic to healthy instances

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/payment-service

# Verify rollback
kubectl rollout status deployment/payment-service
```

## Post-Incident Actions
1. **Create Incident Report**: Document timeline and impact
2. **Schedule Post-Mortem**: Within 24 hours
3. **Update Runbook**: Incorporate lessons learned
4. **Review Monitoring**: Improve alerting if needed
```

### 6. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

#### ADR Template
```markdown
# ADR-001: Payment Service Database Technology

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select a database technology for the payment service that can:
- Handle 10,000+ transactions per second
- Provide ACID compliance for financial transactions
- Support 99.99% availability
- Meet PCI DSS compliance requirements

## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL with read replicas and connection pooling.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- ACID compliance ensures data consistency
- Mature ecosystem with extensive tooling
- Strong community support and documentation
- Built-in security features support PCI compliance

**Negative:**
- Requires careful tuning for high-performance workloads
- Need to manage read replica lag
- More complex backup and recovery procedures

## Implementation
- Primary PostgreSQL instance with 2 read replicas
- PgBouncer for connection pooling
- Automated backup to encrypted S3 storage
- Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

## Compliance Notes
- Encryption at rest using AES-256
- Network encryption with TLS 1.3
- Access controls with role-based permissions
- Audit logging for all data access
```

## Enterprise Deliverables

1. **Comprehensive system documentation with 100% coverage**
2. **API documentation with OpenAPI specifications**
3. **Operational runbooks for all critical scenarios**
4. **Architecture decision records (ADRs)**
5. **Compliance and security documentation**
6. **Developer onboarding guides (<4 hour setup)**
7. **Incident response procedures and escalation guides**
